# Scrapping-YouTube-data-using-YouTube-data-API-in-Python

Created a YouTube API Key to access YouTube data and demonstrated the step-by-step process of generating the key.
Explored the official Google API documentation, breaking down various sections to understand how to access different YouTube data using the API key.
Utilized Google Colab to write Python code for the project, setting up a new virtual environment for a clean and isolated development.
Divided the project into two parts:
In the first part, extracted channel details such as name, total subscribers, total views, and total videos for several Data Analyst/Data Scientist channels. Utilized pandas to transform the data and created visualizations for comparison between channels.
In the second part, developed a logic to extract video details, including title, total views, likes, favorites, and comments for all videos from a specific channel. Loaded and analyzed the data using pandas and created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
